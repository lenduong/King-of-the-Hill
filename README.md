# King-of-the-Hill
King of the hill is a project whose goal is to design an automated car that can detect slopes. 
The car is programmed to drive up the hill when a slope is detected, and stop when at the top
when a flat surface is detected. There are a few constraints to this projects which made 
the development process harder: 

1) Only 2 AA batteries are allowed
2) The car has to have enough torque to roll up a steep hill
3) An accellerometer must be used to sense the slope

More details regarding the car can be found in my lab report, including different design
iterations throughout the evolution of our car.

# DISCLAIMER
While most of the car's code and electrical design were my effort, I was also collaborating with my
teammates to carry out this project, which in turn has helped improve my skills in effectively
communicating technical knowledge to my teammates, as well as how to collaborate efficiently.
